--- OVERVIEW ---
* Deathtrap damage has been buffed significantly, across the board (all attacks).
* Several of Gaige's skills have been given 2x, 3x, or higher buffs.
* Several of Gaige's skills reworked to give some sort of bonus per anarchy stack.
* On that note, per stack bonus to skills now is nonlinear at 5% scaling. Bonus = Rate * Stacks^1.05
* Hence, all skills (except Anarchy) actually give a bonus per SCALED Anarchy stack. Anarchy itself does not do this,
* because it is not borrowing and scaling With Claws' calculation for the per stack bonus.
* Some skills reworked to give cross tree synergy.
* Damage is currently overtuned, slag is irrelevant on OP10. This is 1.0 version, so it's not much of a problem.
